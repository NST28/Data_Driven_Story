For this project, Iâ€™m exploring global space missions using a dataset of 3,000 launches from different countries in the period from 2000 to 2025. Each mission includes details like year, mission type (manned or unmanned), satellite purpose, budget, success rate, technologies used, environmental impact, and collaborating countries. The dataset is referenced from the Global Space Exploration Dataset (2000 2025) published on Kaggle.
